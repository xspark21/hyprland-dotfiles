# my hyprland-dotfiles

Since I discovered linux (especially arch) and hyprland I've really loved the way we can just config everything 
so, my intention to this repo is to set my own dotfiles, 
well... not just because I usually broke my system and had to formatting everything 3 or 4 times...

This setup is a **work in progress** and evolves as I improving it
