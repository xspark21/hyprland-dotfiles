# my hyprland-dotfiles

Since I discovered linux (especially arch) and hyprland I've really loved the way we can just config everything 
so, my intention to this repo is to set my own dotfiles, 
well... not just because I usually broke my system and had to formatting everything 3 or 4 times...

This setup is a **work in progress** and evolves as I improving it

---

## Included configurations

- hyprland
- waybar
- dunst
- kitty
- neovim
- rofi
- ranger
- MPD / rmpc
- other small utilities

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xspark21/hyprland-dotfiles.git
```

Copy only the configs you want into `~/.config`:

```bash
cp -r hypr waybar kitty nvim ~/.config/
```

it's recommended to back up your existing configs before copying

There's no `install.sh` yet
